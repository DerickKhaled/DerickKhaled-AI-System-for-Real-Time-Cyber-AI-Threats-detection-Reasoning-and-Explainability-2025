# 🛡️ Cognitive AI for Cybersecurity: A Neuro-Symbolic, RL, and Agentic Hybrid Framework

## Overview
This repository accompanies the paper **“Cognitive Hybrid AI System for Real-Time Cyber Intelligence Threat Detection”**.  
We introduce a novel **cognitive AI framework** that integrates:
- 🧩 **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning** for logical transparency and rule-based adaptability  
- 🤖 **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for dynamic decision-making under adversarial conditions  
- 🌫️ **Fuzzy Uncertainty Handling** for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguity  
- 🗨️ **Agentic LLM Chatbot ("System Brain")** for explainability, analyst training, and natural-language queries  

Our system enables **real-time fraud detection, adversarial robustness, interpretability, and resilience** against both current and emerging AI-powered cyberattacks.

## 🔥 Problem
Traditional ML-based fraud detection and intrusion systems suffer from:
- Rigid thresholds → vulnerable to adversarial bypass  
- Lack of interpretability → “black-box” decisions hinder analyst trust  
- Dependence on massive retraining → poor adaptability to zero-day attacks  
- Inability to **separate authentic from falsified data streams**  

---

## 💡 Solution
We propose a **hybrid cognitive AI architecture** that:
1. Detects threats with **perfect accuracy under adversarial noise**, outperforming XGBoost, neural-only, and RL-only baselines  
2. Differentiates **genuine vs. fake data streams** reliably, even when adversarially manipulated  
3. Provides **explainable reasoning tracebacks** and human-readable narratives through the LLM chatbot  
4. Adapts to **novel and unforeseen attacks** by updating symbolic rules while leveraging RL for continuous learning  

---

## 📊 Results
- **Ensemble Hybrid System**: Precision = 1.0, Recall = 1.0, F1 = 1.0  
- **XGBoost baseline**: collapses under noisy adversarial input (F1 = 0.52)  
- Demonstrated **real-time detection** with latency < 50 ms  
- Transparent, analyst-friendly **Explainable AI (XAI)** reports via chatbot

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. Data ingestion & preprocessing  
2. Threat detection (XGBoost / RL / Neuro-Symbolic module)  
3. Hybrid ensemble fusion with fuzzy reasoning  
4. Analyst-facing **LLM Agentic Chatbot** for explanations & queries

## 📌 Limitations
- Symbolic rules must be updated when **entirely new attack strategies** emerge  
- Real-time RL decision-making requires **scalable big-data infrastructure** for high-volume cyber environments
