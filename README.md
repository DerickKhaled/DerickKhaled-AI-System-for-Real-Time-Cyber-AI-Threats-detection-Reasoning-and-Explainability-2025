# 🛡️ Cognitive AI for Cybersecurity: A Neuro-Symbolic, RL, and Agentic Hybrid Framework

## Overview
This repository accompanies the paper **“Cognitive Hybrid AI System for Real-Time Cyber Intelligence Threat Detection”**.  
We introduce a novel **cognitive AI framework** that integrates:
- 🚀  **Autonomous real-time decision-making** with reinforcement learning agents 
- 🧩 **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning** for logical transparency and rule-based adaptability  
- 🤖 **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for dynamic decision-making under adversarial conditions  
- 🌫️ **Fuzzy Uncertainty Handling** for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguity  
- 🗨️ **Agentic LLM Chatbot ("System Brain")** for explainability, analyst training, and natural-language queries  

Our system enables **real-time fraud detection, adversarial robustness, interpretability, and resilience** against both current and emerging AI-powered cyberattacks.

## 🔥 Problem
Traditional ML-based fraud detection and intrusion systems suffer from:
- Rigid thresholds → vulnerable to adversarial bypass  
- Lack of interpretability → “black-box” decisions hinder analyst trust  
- Dependence on massive retraining → poor adaptability to zero-day attacks  
- Inability to **separate authentic from falsified data streams**  

---

## 💡 Solution
We propose a **hybrid cognitive AI architecture** that:
1. Detects threats with **perfect accuracy under adversarial noise**, outperforming XGBoost, neural-only, and RL-only baselines  
2. Differentiates **genuine vs. fake data streams** reliably, even when adversarially manipulated  
3. Provides **explainable reasoning tracebacks** and human-readable narratives through the LLM chatbot  
4. Adapts to **novel and unforeseen attacks** by updating symbolic rules while leveraging RL for continuous learning

## 🔎 Results

Our experiments evaluated the proposed system against both traditional and advanced baselines under noisy adversarial conditions:

- **Neuron-Symbolic Logic AI (noisy):** Achieved strong robustness with Precision = 0.97, Recall = 0.96, F1 = 0.97.  
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent (noisy):** Adapted effectively to dynamic attack vectors, with Precision = 0.99, Recall = 0.94, F1 = 0.97.
- **XGBoost (baseline, noisy input):** Collapsed under adversarial perturbations with F1 = 0.52, highlighting vulnerability to manipulated data streams.  
- **Voting System Ensemble Hybrid (Proposed):** Outperformed all baselines with **Precision = 1.0, Recall = 1.0, F1 = 1.0**, maintaining real-time operation with latency < 50ms.  

📊 **Key Insight:**  
These results confirm the system’s ability not only to resist adversarial manipulation but also to reliably differentiate between genuine and fake inputs, ensuring resilience against both current and future AI-driven attack patterns.
